# Given an array A of size N, print the reverse of it.

# Input:
# First line contains an integer denoting the test cases 'T'. 
# T testcases follow. Each testcase contains two lines of input. First line contains N the size of the array A. 
# The second line contains the elements of the array.

# Constraints:
# 1 <= T <= 100
# 1 <= N <=100
# 0 <= Ai <= 100

# Example:
# Input:
# 1
# 4
# 1 2 3 4
# Output:
# 4 3 2 1

### This part of the code does not solve the problem as it reverses an array without a test case


arr = []
sizeOfArray = len(arr)

# A --- Array
# N -- Size of the Array
def autoReverser(A, N):
    N = N -1
    while N >= 0:
        print(A[N])
        N -=1

autoReverser(arr ,sizeOfArray)
